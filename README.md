# squares

I created this code for the release of my second album, [Tapes From Nowhere](https://simonmartineau.bandcamp.com/album/tapes-from-nowhere). It uses the colors from the album cover to generate a visual representation based on the sound. Designed to work with [Processing](https://processing.org/), it requires the `Minim` library.
